Using osTickets admin panel, I was able to add any user(s) I wanted to practice in a real life scenario. I chose two fake names to make things simple. Each agent was put into a different department and given a different role so I can pratcice seeing how tickets move through each person depending on the department and role they are in.

<p>
After creating my agents and users, I set up the Servie Level Agreements for my mock company. I know each company is different, so I only made three different ones; A being most important while C was less priority.

<p>
Now that everything is set up correctly, I can experience how to make tickets from a customers perspective and also work the ticket from the company side.
